Fully dynamic connectivity algorithm in O(log^2 n) amortised complexity per operation according to Holm and de Lichtenberg.

The interface is defined in dc.hpp.

For use examples, see cf_a.cpp and cf_e.cpp.

For testing the implementation test-san (with sanitizers) and test-opt (without them) can be used.
